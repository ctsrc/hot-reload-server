# http-horse üê¥

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/http-horse.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/http-horse)

`http-horse` is an HTTP Hot Reload Server designed for web development with HTML,
CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and WebAssembly. This tool allows you to automatically
reload your web pages as you develop, providing a seamless development experience.

**Note:** `http-horse` currently only supports macOS üçéüíª.
Support for other operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD) is planned but not yet available.

## Installation

In the future, pre-built binaries will be provided for installation.

For now, please build from git repo sources (described in the next section),
or use cargo to install the latest release from crates.io:

```zsh
cargo install -f http-horse
```

## Building `http-horse` from git repo sources

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your macOS system.
Then, you can clone this repository and build the application using Cargo:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/ctsrc/http-horse.git
cd http-horse
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To serve a directory containing your web project's output files,
use the following command:

```zsh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- ./example_web_project/out/
```

This command starts `http-horse`, which will serve both a status page
and your project's pages. The output will provide the URLs for both servers:

```text
2023-10-29T05:06:49.278038Z  INFO http_horse: Status pages will be served on http://[::1]:59917
2023-10-29T05:06:49.278089Z  INFO http_horse: Project pages will be served on http://[::1]:59918
```

Open these URLs in your web browser to view the status and project pages.

### Automatic Browser Launch

To automatically open the status and project pages in your default web browser,
use the `--open` option (`-o` for short):

```zsh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- --open ./example_web_project/out/
```

### Status Web-UI Color Schemes

The status web-UI supports five built-in color schemes:

- **Midnight Purple** (Dark Mode)
- **Slate Green** (Dark Mode)
- **Abyss Blue** (Dark Mode)
- **Graphite & Copper** (Dark Mode, default)
- **Crimson & Charcoal** (Dark Mode)

You can select a color scheme using the `--color-scheme` (`-c`) option. For example:

```zsh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- -c crimson-and-charcoal --open ./example_web_project/out/
```

The corresponding argument values for the available color schemes are as follows:

- `midnight-purple`
- `slate-green`
- `abyss-blue`
- `graphite-and-copper`
- `crimson-and-charcoal`

### Editing your Project Source Files

To make changes to your project, edit your project source files
using your favorite code editor. For example:

```zsh
$EDITOR ./example_web_project/www/index.htm
```

### Rebuilding your Project

After editing, rebuild your project.

In the following example, a Makefile is used, but `http-horse` is compatible
with any build system. All that is required is that your build system outputs
the built files into some directory that `http-horse` can then serve from
and watch for changes.

```zsh
cd example_web_project/
make
```

See [`example_web_project/GNUmakefile`](example_web_project/GNUmakefile)
for a very basic sample makefile that copies an index html source file
from `example_web_project/www/` into `example_web_project/out/` without
making any changes to it. The principle remains the same although in
the real world you would usually have your build system make some
kind of transformation on the source file or source files when
producing output files.

### Viewing Changes

When the project is rebuilt, the project pages that you have
open in your browser will automatically reload to reflect the changes.

## Advanced Usage

`http-horse` aims to support more advanced use cases, such as automatically
running build commands when source files change. This feature is planned
for future releases.

Example of the intended usage (feature not yet implemented):

```zsh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- -c "make" -d example_web_project/ -C example_web_project/www/ example_web_project/out/
```

Explanation of parameters in form of an ASCII "diagram":

```text
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- -c "make" -C example_web_project/ -w example_web_project/www/ example_web_project/out/

                                         ^         ^                       ^                        ^
  -c defines build command to run  ------'         '--.                    |                        |
     when changes are detected in                     |                    |                        |
     the source dir.                                  |                    |                        |
                                                      |                    |                        |
  -C specifies working dir to run build command in.  -'                    |                        |
                                                                           |                        |
  -w indicates source dir to watch for changes.  --------------------------'                        |
                                                                                                    |
  Positional argument specifies out-dir to watch for changes.  -------------------------------------'
```

Put in a bulleted list:

- `-c`: Defines the build command to run when changes are detected in the source directory.
  * The build command can be the name of a single command (such as, `"make"`), but it can
    also include any parameters that you want to pass to the build command.
    E.g.: `"make -B -d"`
- `-C`: Specifies the working directory in which the build command is to be executed.
- `-w`: Indicates the directory to watch for source file changes.
  * This argument can be repeated multiple times if multiple different source directories
    are to be watched, provided that the build command (`-c` argument) and build
    working directory (`-C` argument) remains the same for all of these source directories.
- Positional argument: Specifies the output directory to monitor for changes.
