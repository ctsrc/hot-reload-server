# Theming and Templating System for http-horse

## Overview

The theming and templating system for http-horse will be designed to provide
a flexible, secure, and scalable foundation for web projects. It aims to meet
the diverse needs of users ranging from basic blogging to complex
e-commerce sites and corporate websites. The system will be built on
a robust templating engine, such as Tera or Askama, as well as ensuring that
themes and templates are secure, accessible, and adaptable to various screen
sizes and resolutions.

## Default Themes

To provide users with an excellent starting point, http-horse will come
with a set of professionally designed default themes. These themes will
cater to common use cases, such as:

1. **Basic Blogging:** A clean and minimal theme focused on content presentation,
   optimized for readability and ease of use.
2. **E-Commerce:** A theme designed for online stores, featuring product grids,
   shopping carts, and checkout pages, all optimized for conversions.
3. **Corporate Website:** A versatile theme suitable for businesses,
   with sections for team members, services, testimonials, and a blog.

These themes will be fully customizable and will serve as a foundation for users
to build their websites. They will also be responsive, adapting seamlessly
to different screen sizes and resolutions, and will be compatible
with screen readers and other accessibility tools.

## Setup Wizard for Theme Selection

During the initial setup of http-horse, users will be guided through
a setup wizard that allows them to choose a theme based on their
specific use case. The wizard will offer the following options:

1. **Basic Blogging:** Ideal for personal blogs, journals,
   or content-focused websites.
2. **E-Commerce:** Designed for users who want to set up
   an online store with essential e-commerce functionalities.
3. **Corporate Website:** Perfect for businesses and organizations
   looking to establish an online presence with professional design.
4. **Headless system:** In this case, no themes or templates will be included,
   as there will be no frontend part to make use of them.

The wizard will also offer options to customize the selected theme,
such as choosing a color scheme, layout preferences, and enabling
or disabling certain features (e.g., a blog section, contact form, etc.).

## Scaling the Number of Themes

As http-horse evolves, the number of available themes
will scale incrementally to meet user demands.
The plan for scaling up to 50,000+ themes includes several key phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Offering and Manual Review

In the initial phase, http-horse will launch with a limited number
of high-quality themes. Each theme will undergo a thorough manual review process
to ensure it meets security standards, is fully responsive,
and is accessible. During this phase, themes will be reviewed for:

- **Security:** Ensuring that no malicious JavaScript (JS) is embedded
  in the themes or templates, and that themes and templates do not introduce
  server-side vulnerabilities. The themes will be "dumb," meaning they
  won't have access to the server system and will rely
  solely on the templating engine for rendering.
- **Responsiveness:** Themes will be tested across different devices
  and screen sizes, ensuring they adapt to various resolutions
  and support high-DPI displays.
- **Accessibility:** All themes will be tested for compatibility
  with screen readers and other accessibility tools, ensuring
  they meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

### Phase 2: Automated Checks and Community Involvement

As the theme repository grows, automated checks will be introduced
to maintain quality and security standards.
These automated systems will perform the following checks:

- **Static Analysis:** Run security checks to detect any embedded or obfuscated
  JavaScript and ensure that no server-side vulnerabilities are present.
- **Performance Testing:** Analyze themes for performance, ensuring
  they load quickly and efficiently across different environments.
- **Accessibility Validation:** Use automated tools to verify that
  themes meet accessibility standards, flagging any potential issues for review.

Additionally, trusted community members will be involved in the review process,
acting as curators to help maintain the quality of the theme repository.
A reputation system will be introduced to incentivize and reward
community members who contribute to maintaining the integrity of the marketplace.

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Review and Scaling

As the theme repository scales towards 50,000+ themes, AI-driven systems
will be implemented to handle the large volume of submissions efficiently.
These systems will perform the following checks:

- **AI-Powered Security Checks:** Automatically scan themes
  for security vulnerabilities, ensuring that no malicious code
  is present and that all themes adhere to the highest security standards.
- **Dynamic Responsiveness Testing:** Simulate different device environments
  to ensure themes are fully responsive and adapt to various screen sizes
  and resolutions.
- **Automated Accessibility Audits:** Continuously monitor themes for compliance
  with accessibility standards, providing real-time feedback to theme developers.

The AI system will also assist in categorizing and recommending themes
based on user preferences and use cases, ensuring that users can easily
find the most suitable themes for their needs.

## Security Considerations

Security is a top priority in the theming and templating system for http-horse.
To ensure that themes and templates cannot introduce vulnerabilities we will have:

1. **Sandboxed Execution:** Themes will be rendered using a secure templating engine
   like Tera or Askama, which will execute in a sandboxed environment,
   preventing access to server-side systems.
2. **No Embedded JavaScript:** The templating system will strictly prohibit
   the inclusion of JavaScript within templates to avoid potential vulnerabilities
   and security threats including XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
3. **Server-Side Isolation:** The templating engine will not have direct access
   to the server's file system or network, reducing the risk of server-side exploits.
4. **Regular Security Audits:** The theme repository will undergo
   regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential threats,
   ensuring that all themes remain safe and secure.

## Accessibility and Adaptability

All themes and templates in http-horse will be required to keep accessibility
and adaptability in mind:

- **Responsive Design:** Themes will be tested and optimized for various
  screen sizes and resolutions, including high-DPI displays.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Themes will be developed in accordance with
  WCAG standards, ensuring compatibility with screen readers
  and other assistive technologies.
- **Customizable Layouts:** Users will have the option to customize layouts,
  colors, and fonts through a user-friendly interface, allowing for
  personalization while maintaining accessibility.

## Conclusion

The theming and templating system for http-horse will be designed to be secure,
scalable, and user-friendly. By offering a curated selection of default themes,
a setup wizard for easy theme selection, and a robust plan for scaling
the number of available themes, http-horse aims to provide users with
a powerful toolset for building and customizing their websites.
The focus on security, responsiveness, and accessibility ensures that
all users will be able to create professional, high-quality websites
with confidence.
